    <h1 class="display-4">Types of Social Engineering</h1>

    <p class="lead">
        This section will discuss the common methods used by threat actors
        to implement their social engineering attacks.
    </p>


    <h1 class="display-4">Phishing</h1>
    <p>Phishing is an attempt by a threat actor to fraudulently claim sensitive information from a potential victim
        such as usernames, passwords, credit card information and bank details. The most commonly used attack vector for phishing is email. An
        example of this is an email claiming
        you have won an iphone and all you have to do to claim your reward is to enter your personal details.</p>

    <h1 class="display-4">Baiting</h1>
    <p class="lead">Baiting involves tricking users into downloading and installing malware onto their system.
        For example a threat actor leaves usb keys loaded with auto installing malware and leaves
        them in public places or in a more targeted attack in a companies office, they do this in
        hopes that an unsuspecting victim plugs this usb key into their own or somebody elses device
        out of curiosity and then the malware is installed usually ransomware of some description.</p>

    <h1 class="display-4">Vishing</h1>
    <p class="lead">Vishing uses phone calls or voice over ip programs to attack their victims. Threat actors will use
        a known companies interactive voice response system and attach it to a free to call number and trick
        unsuspecting victims to call and then enter their details into the system </p>

    <h1 class="display-4">Spear Phishing</h1>
    <p class="lead">Spear phishing is a more specific form of phishing, spear phishing involves targeting a specific group
        or individual, a threat actor will require greater knowledge of their victim for example an attacker
        targets an employee of a company and sends them an email appearing to be from his/her manager in hopes
        for them to be tricked into disclosing information. </p>
