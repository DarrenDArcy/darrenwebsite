        <h1 class="text-center">Life Cycle of a social Engineering attack</h1>
<br>
        <h2 class="text-left"> 1.  Information Gathering</h2>
       <p class="text-justify"> This phase is the most important phase the social engineer spends
           a lot of time gathering as much information as possible on their vitcim
           . A lot of the information gathering may be done on social media.
        Some of the information gathered is used to determine the attack vector, possible passwords, i
        dentify likely responses from various individuals, refine goals, become familiar and comfortable with
           the target, and formulate strong pretext(s).</p>

        <h2 class="text-left"> 2. Establish Relationship and Rapport</h2>
        <p class="text-justify"> This phase initiates contact with the target and creates a relationship.
            This is a critical point as the quality of the relationship
            built by the attacker determines the level of cooperation and extent to which
            the target will go to help the attacker accomplish the goal.
            It could be as simple as connecting on a personal level
            over the phone or as personal as showing family pictures and sharing stories with the
            receptionist in the lobby. It can also be as extensive as building an online relationship
            with the target through a fake profile on a dating or social networking site. </p>

        <h2 class="text-left"> 3.  Exploitation</h2>
        <p class="text-justify"> During this phase the attacker combines the information that they have gathered and
            the relationship they have established.
            In this phase, the attacker must keep the trust that has been established
            already in phase 2 and continue with their objective without raising suspiscion. Exploitation can take place through the
            divulging of seemingly unimportant information or access granted/transferred to the attacker. Examples of
            successful exploitation include:

        <ol start="1">
        <li> The act of holding the door open or otherwise allowing the attacker inside the facilities</li>
        <li>Disclosing password and username over the phone</li>
        <li> Inserting a USB flash drive with a malicious payload to a computer</li>
        <li>Opening an infected email attachment</li>
        <li>Exposing trade or personal secrets in a discussion with a trusted party</li></ol></p>


        <h2 class="text-left">4.  Execution</h2>
        <p class="text-justify"> This phase of the attack occurs when the initially set out
            goals have been reached, and the attacker must exit the situation ideally without raising suspicion. This phase is when the ultimate goal of the attack is
            It is not good for the social engineer to leave the victim questioning what has happened.
            Instead, it is better to leave the target feeling as if they did something good for someone else which
            can allow for future exploitations. </p>
